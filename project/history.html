                <h2>40 Years Of Unbridled Creativity</h2>
                <p>Throughout their 40-year career, Phish has gone through many changes of their sound. Most fans divide these “eras” into three groups: 1.0, which goes from the start of the band until their first hiatus in 2001; 2.0, which goes from their return in 2002 until their official break-up in 2004; and 3.0, which goes from their reunion in 2009 until the present day. However, these broad eras don’t capture the full range of the change in their sound over the years. Thus, I have broken those eras up even more to explain how the band sounded throughout different stages in their career:</p>

                            <p>These are the early years of Phish; the years they spent cutting their teeth playing small bars, frat houses, friend’s farms, and really anywhere else that would book them. You can hear them here finding their sound and enjoying to the fullest of being young, early-20s kids just playing music.</p>

                        <p>Here is where the hard grind starts to pay off for Phish. The band is starting to get national attention. They’re not just playing the northeast club circuit anymore; they’re heading out to bigger and bigger clubs and theaters all across the country. Their playing is more dialed in, more intense, and more exploratory.</p>

                        <p>With the addition of Page’s baby grand piano in 1993, Phish has now become a powerhouse, moving from clubs and small theaters to arenas. The fan base starts pick up steam here as well, and by 1995, after the death of Jerry Garcia and consequentially the end of the Grateful Dead, Phish becomes the de facto leaders of the jam band world. In 1996, the band puts on its first solo festival, heralding a new age in the American music festival scene. The band’s playing here has matured, deepened, and expanded into arena rock bliss.</p>

                        <p>The “Cow Funk” era. The band at this point is on top of the world, and Phish Tour has turned into one big party. To match this, Phish adopted an extremely funky sound, taking great inspiration from James Brown and the meters. The crazy note-filled jams are replaced with a more groove-based orientation.</p>

                        <p>By 1999, Phish has taken the groove-based approach to a whole new level. Mike and Fish are now center stage, reinforcing the idea that the groove is now taking the lead. The funk takes a step back however, and the Phish experiment now takes on a more ambient approach. The deep grooves are accompanied by sparse soundscapes from Trey and Page, making the listener feel like they are floating through space.</p>

                        <p>After a brief hiatus in 2001, Phish returned to the stage in 2002 a little disheveled and a little burnt out from their success. The partying and the drugs had taken their toll, and this era is marked by off-kilter shows and a general weird vibe all around, leading to the eventual break-up of the band. That being said, this era isn’t without its great moments, and the good playing during this time is powerful, emotion driven mega-rock jams.</p>
