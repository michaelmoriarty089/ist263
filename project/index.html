                    <h1>Who is Phish?</h1>
                    <p>Phish is a rock band that was formed at the University of Vermont in 1983 by four guys: Trey, Page, Mike, and Jon. With humble beginnings as a goofy prog-rock band playing small bars, they bulldozed their way through the 1990s to become one of the highest selling live acts of all time.</p><br>
                    <p>Renowned for their spellbinding improvisational skills, Phish's live shows are legendary, drawing comparisons to the iconic Grateful Dead. Each concert is an unparalleled spectacle, a freewheeling musical journey where no two shows are ever the same. These jam sessions have cemented Phish as titans of live music, beloved for their unpredictable performances and the palpable energy they generate.</p>

                        <h3>Instruments: electric and acoustic guitars, drums, megaphone, percussion, vocals.</h3>
                        <p>Ernest Joseph “Trey” Anastasio III is the guitar player, main lead singer, band leader, and main songwriter for the band. While each member of the band is crucial and integral to this band, it is Trey’s vision and creative prowess that drives the band forward. Widely considered to be among the all-time greats of the guitar, Trey’s effortless melodies and masterful direction of improvisation will carry listeners on many magical journeys filled with wonder and splendor.</p>

                        <h3>Instruments: electric bass, standup bass, banjo, acoustic guitar, electric drill, foot bell, vocals.</h3>
                        <p>Mike Gordon is the bass player and occasional lead singer for the band. Mike is the anchor for the band; the one member the rest can rely on to hold the ship down when things go off the rails. Despite being a world-class bass player, Mike often opts to forgo flashiness and displays of his skills in favor of a more atmospheric approach. Whatever backdrop fits best to what the rest of the band is playing, that is what Mike will play. That isn’t to say he won’t knock your socks off with some rippin’ bass lines or a few well placed “Gordo Bombs” when given the chance.</p>

                        <p>Page McConnell is the keyboard player and occasional lead singer for the band. As the last member of the band to join, Page was the missing ingredient that made the band into the delicious entrée that we know and love today. Whether he’s crashing down epic chords on his baby grand piano, getting deep into the funk on his clavinet, or blazing through a hot organ solo, Page deftly utilizes his massive arsenal of keyboards to deliver the perfect sounds at the perfect moments.</p>

                        <p>Jon Fishman is the drummer and heart and soul of the band. Immediately upon hearing his drums in the dorms at the University of Vermont, Trey knew he needed to find this player and start a band with him. Jon is sometimes called an octopus, because much of his playing just seems impossible to play with only four limbs. His expertise at seamlessly integrating intricate polyrhythms with deep pocket grooves gives an incredible complex rhythm structure for the rest of the band to play with without sacrificing danceability keeps both his bandmates and fans grinning from ear to ear.</p>

                        <p>Chris Kuroda is the lighting director for Phish’s live shows. His ability to perfectly fit the lighting to whatever the band is improvising onstage has led to fans dubbing him the unofficial fifth member of the band (hence the nickname of “CK5”). Due to the mastery of his art and the immense lighting rig that now accompanies the band onstage, his light show is now almost as much of a crowd draw as the band itself.</p>
